# caterpillar_game

The Classic "Snake Game" of our childhood but with a little twist.

Help the caterpillar eat enough food pills so it can start cocooning and start the process of metamorphosis.

The number of food pills the catterpillar has to eat depends entirely on you. Watch out for the mesmerizing butterfly at the end!

Use the direction keys to get started.
